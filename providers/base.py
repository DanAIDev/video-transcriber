"""Base classes and contracts for transcription providers.

A *provider* is an implementation that knows how to:
1. Accept an audio (or video) file URI and create an asynchronous transcription job.
2. Poll or query the state of an existing job.
3. Download the final transcription artefacts to a local destination.

The surrounding application (see ``core.pipeline``) is provider-agnostic;
all interactions must go through the ``AbstractTranscriptionProvider`` API below.
